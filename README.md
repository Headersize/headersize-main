# Headersize social media image templates

Looking for the latest pixel sizes for your social media images? In this repository youâ€™ll find sample images and source files (Photoshop PSD, Fireworks PNG) to get you started. 

Social media networks often change the dimensions of cover images, timeline images and other assets. We try to update this repository whenever such a change happens, so you can adapt to the new image size as quickly as possible.

## For developers

The data.json is a JSON formatted file which contains the latest pixel dimensions and other useful data, which can be easily processed by most programming languages. We look forward to seeing your awesome implementations of this file! Automatically updating cover images, anyone?

## Contributing
